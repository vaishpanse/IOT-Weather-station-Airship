Every person's existence involves a great deal of weather monitoring.Numerous problems arise as a result of the state of the environment in a number of industries, including construction, agriculture, and more. However, the quantifiable influence mostly happens in

farming and business. Farmers might benefit from weather monitoring with the use of a weather monitoring system. A weather station is a technological breakthrough that uses amazing devices and sensors to collect data related to the weather.The objective of this project is to demonstrate how the Arduino microcontroller platform can be used to measure the temperature and humidity of your environment using a DHT22 sensor display.
