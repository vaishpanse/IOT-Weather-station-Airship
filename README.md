# IOT-Weather-station-Airship
An IoT weather station airship is a type of instrument equipped with sensors and communication technology to collect meteorological data and transmit it in real-time. These airships are designed to be deployed into the atmosphere to gather information such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and air quality at various altitudes.

### Components Required:
1. Arduino Uno <br>
2. DHT22 Temperature and humidity sensor< br>
3. 16×2 LCD <br>
4. Breadboard <br>
5. Jumper wires<br>
6. Resistor 1k

### Components Description:
1. Arduino Uno:<br>
The Arduino UNO is a standard board of Arduino. Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs),
6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller.

2. DHT22 Sensor:<br>
It is a digital Humidity and Temperature sensor.Its temperature measuring range is from -40°C to +125°C with +-0.5 degrees accuracy also it has better humidity
measuring range, from 0 to 100% with 2-5% accuracy.

   Pin Description:<br>
    1. VCC - Positive voltage<br>
    2. DATA - Digital data pin (input/output)<br>
    3. NC- Not connected<br>
    4. GND - Ground

3. LCD :<br>
A 16×2 LCD display is an electronic device that is used to display data and messages. It includes 16 Columns & 2 Rows so it can display 32 characters (16×2=32) in total &
every character will be made with 5×8 (40) Pixel Dots.
